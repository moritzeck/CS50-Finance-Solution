# About
The description of this problem set is as follows: You’re about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. 
Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying 
IEX for stocks’ prices. For more informations about this project, go check out this link: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/9/finance/
